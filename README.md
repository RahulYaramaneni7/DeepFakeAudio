# Audio-DeepFake-Classification
# Project Description
This project focuses on detecting audio deepfakes by developing a deep learning model that differentiates between genuine (bona fide) and manipulated (spoof) audio recordings. The goal is to identify artificially altered speech designed to imitate authentic voices. The model is trained and evaluated using the ASVspoof 2017 dataset(provided in the dataset repo of the project assessment part-2 section).
